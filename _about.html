<h1>The Founder - Will Schiller</h1>
<p>I'm an entrepreneur and just like any respectable entrepreneur I focus not on ideas but problems. An idea is only as good as the problem it solves. At BitHouse, I focus on solving just one of the vast problems that is disseminating quality of life for people all over Europe and the US. Housing inequality, banking system failures and wealth extraction, concentration and inequality.</p>
