    <h1>The economic solution for Generation Rent</h1>
    <p>BitHouse is a platform that enables a property to be registered on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum Blockchain</a> as a decentralised autonomous house and rented in exchange for equity. In essence, it’s smart mortgage  and rental contract combined. The mortgage can be paid off by anyone who rents part of, or all the property and there is no limit to the number of equity holders. Equity is fluid, so there is no technical difference between a renter and an equity holder. Equity and capital are distributed dynamically through a central balance sheet secured through blockchain technology. BitHouse allows banks to provide a mortgage like service to dramatically more people while massively reducing the financial risk and removing the high administrative costs of repossessions. Creating a bridge for renters to become homeowners; A core problem for banks and society and a leading factor in the ongoing economic crisis.</p>

      <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>In many EU countries, there is a “Housing Trap” which burdens young adults.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Renting is too expensive.</li>
          <li>Buying is not an option because of the even greater cost.</li>
          <li>Getting a mortgage is nearly impossible.</li>
          <li>There is not enough social housing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This has lead to record levels of people between the ages of 18-34 living with their parents. In Portugal 58% of young adults live at home, in Spain it’s 55%, in Italy it’s 66% and in Slovakia, 74% still live at home.</p>
        <p>A typical young person in the EU lives with the knowledge that if they work hard, they still have little social mobility or opportunities to own their property. Worse still even highly skilled workers who move to industrial hubs like London, Paris or Brussel find themselves living in inadequate housing and struggling to pay rent. One in Four renters in London spends more than half their income on rent, and the average UK renter spends 39% of their income on rent. London is typical of many of Europe's major cities that are now at risk of losing their competitive edge due to an inability to house those skilled workers that they need to maintain the level of innovation that has defined them.</p>
        <p>Habitat.org in a <a href="https://www.habitat.org/sites/default/files/housing_review_2015_full_report_final_small_reduced.pdf" target="blank" title="Housing Review 2015: Affordability Sustainability Livability">recent study</a> concluded that:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.habitat.org/sites/default/files/housing_review_2015_full_report_final_small_reduced.pdf">Based on the economic and financial growth and deregulation trends since the 1970s and the merging of housing finance into the general financial sector in the 1990s, our key diagnosis is that the risks inherent in the commodification of housing have eventually surfaced in the global financial crisis.</blockquote>
        <p>According to <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/campaigns_/why_we_campaign/the_housing_crisis/census" target="_blank">shelter</a>:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://england.shelter.org.uk/campaigns_/why_we_campaign/the_housing_crisis/census">The latest Census shows that, in England, the proportion of homes owned with a mortgage has dropped by 15% and now stands at 34% of homes. The proportion of private rented homes has rocketed by 69%.
        <br/><br/>
        This historic shift reflects the growing trend in young people and families who are unable to find a stable, affordable home.</blockquote>
        <p>Even if the US housing market now looks to be headed towards another boom, there is still a lot of speculation as to how sustainable it will be. Some <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/duke20130308a.htm" target="_blank">government officials</a> are pushing for banks to once again relax credit restrictions, lend more and take on more risk to maintain the growing housing boom. But some of this predicted sustainability is based on young people entering long-term employment and thus entering into and maintaining long-term mortgage agreements. A prediction of the future labour market as akin to the pre-financial crisis market is short sighted because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The level of freelancers is set to rise dramatically. One <a href="http://http-download.intuit.com/http.intuit/CMO/intuit/futureofsmallbusiness/intuit_2020_report.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> puts it at 40% of the US workforce by 2020.</li>
          <li>There will be a huge increase in automation. A study by The Bank of England <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/864.aspx" target="_blank">suggests</a> 15 million UK jobs and 85 million US jobs could be replaced with automation.</li>
          <li>An increase in remote working for social, environmental and optimisation reasons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this along with technological changes such as new forms of peer2peer networks and the numerous so-called "sharing economy " tech giants like airBnB and Uber set to add increasing volatility into the labour markets. The notion of a "job for life" for most people at least is over. Increasingly this means that entering into an average 25-year mortgage is for most people unrealistic and perhaps even increasingly undesirable.</p>
        <p>At the same time, wealth is concentrating at an increasingly rapid rate. 62 People now own the same as the poorest 50% and the top 1% own more than the rest of the world combined.</p>
        <p>One of the leading factors in the increasing wealth inequality outlined by <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/01/62-people-own-same-as-half-world-says-oxfam-inequality-report-davos-world-economic-forum" target="_blank">Oxfam</a>:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/01/62-people-own-same-as-half-world-says-oxfam-inequality-report-davos-world-economic-forum">is the falling share of national income going to workers in almost all developed and most developing countries and a widening gap between pay at the top and the bottom of the income scale.</blockquote>
        <p>Even with the initial signs of recovery these issues are compounding and growing fast. Supercharged by technology and automation the extraction of wealth is now faster and more efficient than ever. The economy may be growing on paper, but it's still fundamentally broken. Of course, the issues are complex and housing is just one component of a larger systematic problem, but the housing crisis could be dramtically improved using technologies such as blockchains and smart contracts and decentralised autonomous organsisations.</p>
