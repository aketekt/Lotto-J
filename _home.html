    <h1>The economic solution for Generation Rent</h1>
    <p>BitHouse is the engine and the catalyst for a different way of living.</p>
    <p>Our first project is to provide shelter, social mobility and organisation to the renting population. Sharing and renting houses will be made easier and more transparent. Creating social and community spaces like co-working buildings, shared art spaces and unique types of shared homes will all be possible.</p>
    <p>For landlords and property owners we provide an alternative search engine to list properties that is free to use. Reputation is built into the system so the best landlords are rewarded with reviews and ratings.</p>
    <p>Revenue will drive development and research into larger re-engineering projects like crypto-equity housing, building communal digital infrastructure and a fluid digital property equity system built for the 21st century. Less risky, more efficient and total freedom to move and share houses in the way that suits you. Essentially a bridge from renting to owning property. Imagine renting a room and getting real equity in property a bit like when you arrange a mortgage but flexible and pay as you go. Equity is fluid and is distributed dynamically.</P>
    <p>Eventually, we would like to see BitHouse owned by its user. A community powering a new economy that is fairer, more logical and works for its people.</p>
    <p>We are open source and free.</p>
