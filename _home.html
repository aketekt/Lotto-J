    <h1>The economic solution for Generation Rent</h1>
    <p>BitHouse is a platform that enables a property to be registered on the Ethereum Blockchain as a decentralised autonomous house and let in exchange for equity. In essence, it’s smart mortgage contract and rental agreement combined. The mortgage can be paid off by anyone who rents part of, or all the property and there is no limit to the number of equity holders. Equity is fluid so there is no technical difference between a renter and an equity holder. Equity and capital are distributed dynamically through a central balance sheet. BitHouse allows banks to provide a mortgage like service to dramatically more people while massively reducing the financial risk and removing the high administrative costs of repossessions. Creating a bridge for renters to become homeowners; A core problem for banks and society and a leading factor in the ongoing economic crisis.</p>

      <h1>The Problem</h1>
    </div>

<div class="wrapper-left">
        <p>In many EU countries there is a “Housing Trap” which burdens young adults.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Renting is too expensive.</li>
          <li>Buying is not an option because of the even greater cost.</li>
          <li>Getting a mortgage is near impossible.</li>
          <li>There is not enough social housing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This has lead to record levels of people between the ages of 18-34 living with their parents. In Portugal 58% of young adults live at home, in Spain it’s 55%, in Italy it’s 66% and in Slovakia, 74% still live at home.</p>
        <p>A typical young person in the EU lives with the knowledge that if they work hard, they still have little social mobility or opportunities to own their property. Worse still even highly skilled workers who move to industrial hubs like London, Paris or Brussel find themselves living in inadequate housing and struggling to pay rent. One in Four renters in London spend more than half their income on rent and 53% of the renters in the UK say they are finding hard to pay their rent. London is typical of many of Europe's major cities that are now at risk of losing their competitive edge due to an inability to house those skilled workers that they need to maintain the level of innovation that has defined them.</p>
        <quote>“Based on the economic and financial growth and
deregulation trends since the 1970s and the merging of
housing finance into the general financial sector in the
1990s, our key diagnosis is that the risks inherent in the
commodification of housing have eventually surfaced in
the global financial crisis.”</quote>
